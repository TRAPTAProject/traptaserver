This is the server application of the TRAPTA project: http://www.trapta.eu
It is to be run on a laptop. The android application sends the data to this server which builds the rankings.

To be compiled on Windows, this program needs the traptatransfer (https://github.com/TRAPTAProject/traptatransfer) repository at the same tree level.

TO DO: add explainations on how to compile and build a release artifact of this project.
